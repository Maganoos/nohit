NoHit+ is a mod that stops you from hitting other players.

NoHit+ is ideal for multiplayer servers where accidental hits can disrupt gameplay, or for players who want to ensure a peaceful environment without harming others. By installing NoHit+, you can avoid conflicts, protect teammates, and enjoy smoother cooperative play.

Bows and Crossbows can also be disabled through the config menu, as well as toggling whether the mod is active.

There is an option to crash the JVM, which does exactly as it says. Any time the message would be sent, your whole JVM would crash without a discernible crash log. Proceed with caution for lost data, and don't come to me if anything bad happens :D
