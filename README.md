NoHit+ is a simple utility mod that intercepts attacks at the packet level, preventing you from hitting other players.

[Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/project/9s6osm5g) is required to run this mod.

Bows and Crossbows can also be disabled through the config menu, as well as toggling whether the mod is active.
